# README
A TRAVEL APP

This is a web application written in Ruby and using Rails framework.
There are USER AND ADMIN.

--USER
User can add photos, comments, create a profile, create a city profile, edit profile, and rate places.
It is almost like a community app where the main concept lies on CITIES AND ATTRACTIONS.

--ADMIN
Admin can follow and check the contents of users. It is just like any other admin that does his job in managing and controlling contents.


EXAMPLE: USER "I" will create a profile and add a place I want others to know. I add a photo of  the place, make a short intro, add its working hours, add  its selling points etc from my perspective.
ADMIN "RESTAURANT" (my choice hhe) will check the contents what user added, but it can't control comment section (ofc).
